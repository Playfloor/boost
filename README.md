# Linux Terminal Beginner Boost

Get started right. Become a shell native. Here’s what we’ll learn:

1. RWX Learning Method
2. Docker for Developers
3. Leveraging Linux Containers
4. Linux Bash Command Line
5. Bash Scripting with Vim
6. Screen and TMUX Multiplexers
7. W3M and Lynx Web Browsers
8. Git, GitHub, and Docker Hub
9. Data, Markdown, and Pandoc
10. Go Command Line Programming

This is the way.

_Old Boost content is here._

## Purpose

The purpose of the Boost is to help you learn to use your most powerful tech asset: your computer running Linux in a container. There’s no “teaching” going on here, just learning. We will cover what to learn and some suggestions about where and how to learn it. The rest is up to you and the community here to support you, as it should be. Some call this “the hard way,” but really it’s the only way. Learning happens in the lab, not the lecture hall.

The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is required.
